Class::StorageFactory
---------------------

1.0 - Sat Apr 16 01:42:12 UTC 2005

I write a lot of OO modules that store data.  These are often very simple and
small, but serializing and unserializing the data is more work than I want to
repeat often.

This module provides a way to store and to fetch data for various objects.  It
currently only supports the YAML format (as used by the module of the same
name), but there's no reason there can't be other factories.  I like to think
that Class::StorageFactory has enough abstraction (and that for the class of
problems this solves, it's a simple enough solution) that this will be easy for
other people to write.

You may use, modify, and distribute this software under the same licensing
terms as Perl 5.8.
